## Forwarding Orders..

What we do is a form of 'dropshipment' - this means our platform does not own, or keep stocklevels of merchant's products that are sold through our platform. A merchant will keep stock of products and affiliates are able to generate and forward orders to a merchant through our platform. 

Normally 'dropshipment' is associated with long delivery times, purchased products are often delivered at your doorstep 4-6 weeks later. This is **not** the case with IAM. Our API is designed in such a way that we make sure items are in stock at the moment of purchase. See our Merchant API documentation for more information.
